# From Research to Security: Real-World Threats and the Evolving Challenge of Detection

## ðŸŽ¯ Abstract

In this talk, weâ€™ll discuss real-world threat scenarios that reveal how attackers bypass modern defenses, escalate privileges, and cause significant financial damage. By dissecting these cases step-by-step, weâ€™ll explore how deep threat understanding and practical security research can drive better detection strategies, despite the increasing complexity of todayâ€™s tech stack. Weâ€™ll also address the ongoing challenge of false positives and share techniques for keeping up to date in a rapidly evolving threat landscape.
