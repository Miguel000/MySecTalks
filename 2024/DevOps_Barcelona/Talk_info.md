# Fortifying DevOps: Understand and Fight Botnets Threats

## ðŸŽ¯ Abstract

In the rapidly evolving landscape of cybersecurity, botnets remain a significant threat to Kubernetes and containerization environments. In this talk, we will present a comprehensive overview of our latest research on new groups, delving into their organizational structures, codebases, and tactics. We will explore how these malicious actors share information, select their targets, and offer their services. By sharing our findings, we hope to raise awareness and facilitate a better understanding of these threats, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective countermeasures. Botnets represent a significant and evolving threat in the cybersecurity landscape. This presentation aims to shed light on the inner workings of these networks based on extensive research and real-world examples. Attendees will gain insights into: - Organization and Structure: Understanding how modern botnets are set up and managed. - Code Analysis: A deep dive into the types of code used by botnet operators to exploit container vulnerabilities. - Information Sharing: Exploring whether and how these networks share data amongst themselves. - Target Selection: Analyzing the methods and criteria used by botnets to choose and attack applications. Our aim is to provide a global view of the current state of botnets, offering valuable knowledge that can aid in the detection, analysis, and mitigation of these threats. This talk is designed for security professionals, researchers, and anyone interested in understanding the complexities and dangers posed by botnets in todayâ€™s digital world.
